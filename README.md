### What and Why
        This is a project getting into react and exploring states and changing them with onClicks. 
        A general project to learn and develop in the react realm.

### Overview of application
        The application is a simple click game where upon clicking an image it will give you a point and then shuffle the cards.
        The goal is to score as high as possible to do so you can not click the same image twice.
        Easter Egg! 
            > If you manage to get 12 images guessed correctly you can continue and do the 12 images again netting you a higher score than just 12 as the maximum.
